MyFirstRPG
==========
I will try to use the ECMAScript 6 version for coding
This is an experimental RPG with procedurally generated dungeon

What is working :
---------------
- Responsive design
- The fog
- Moving the Hero
- Generating levels
- Moving back to previous levels

What will come :
--------------
- Creating the Hero (name, strengh, dexterity ...)
- Generating items
- Generating monsters
- Combats and their results
- Managing a little inventory (equip and drop items)
- Saving the game to play later
- Give the monsters an AI (move, attitude toward the Hero, equip with items ...)
- Taking into account the monsters with equipped items for combat
- Advanced combat system (close combat, ranged combat, magic ...)
- Inventory (restrictions for placing equipements ...)
- Add info about an item when hovering it with the mouse
- Make the game compatible with IE
